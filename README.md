# Moonscang-PXKNU
A UNIX-like macro kernel developed from scratch.
I'm going to use C/C++, Rust, Python,and assembly to develop this macro kernel

PKXNU[**P**(PalaceOS)**X**(XinhoxOS)**K**(kernel)**N**(is Not)**U**(UNIX)]
> In fact, whether this kernel can be persisted or not, it is not certain, but I hope it can! Come on, Mooncang!
